# CIRCULAR-ISM
Simple magazine circulation system (internal use)

## Introduction
### Background
In my current company, there are legacy application which still used to manage
magazine circulation and inventory. Somewhat, due to its age (~4 years), it cannot
compete and deliver the same performance, thus slowing any access made to it.

### Goal
I want to make a simple application to organize magazine/product/anything.
Something like an inventory manager with [invoice](#), [DO#](#), [Sales report](#) support.

please note that this is a *private* application.
you may fork/dowload/use or such but its development, features
bugfixes or anything else is pretty much done personally.

## Requirements
- PHP 5.6
- Laravel 5
- MySQL database

## Planned Features
- See: [DB-Architecture](#)
- support sales report and prints
